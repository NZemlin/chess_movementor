Link Problems:
    In list of variations for one move, if there is immedaitely another variation(s) off of that, needs a child node and 2 variation nodes, ie:
    4... Nxe4 5. d5
       |
       |
       4... d6 5. d5
       |          5. Bd3 g6
       4... d5 5. Bb5

    4... d6 needs to link to 5. d5, 4... d5, and 5. Bd3
